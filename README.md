# PyhonVideoSearch_by_ChatGPT.py
This python script was completely written by ChatGPT Dec 15 Version. It allows the user to specify a folder and search for all ".mp4", ".avi", ".mkv", and ".mov" files within that folder. The script creates a simple HTML file with hyperlinks to the file paths of the found files.

This can be useful for locating certain files that are lost deep within the vast span of folder trees on a hard drive. For example, you might use this script to find old videos that you had tucked away somewhere and forgotten. However, you can modify the script to find any file type you like, or expand upon it for more detailed functionality and style.

To run this script, you will need the 'Humanize' python package installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install humanize
```
## Usage
To use this script, simply run it in your terminal and follow the prompts. The script will ask you to enter the path of the folder you want to search, and then it will search for all ".mp4", ".avi", ".mkv", and ".mov" files within that folder and its subfolders. The found files will be listed in a simple HTML file called manifest.html, which will be created in the same directory as the script.

## Modification
You can modify this script to find different file types or add additional functionality as desired. For example, you might want to add a function that allows the user to specify the file type to search for, or add more detailed styling to the HTML file. Feel free to use and modify this script as needed to meet your specific needs.
